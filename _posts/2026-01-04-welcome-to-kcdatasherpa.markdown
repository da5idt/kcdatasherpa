If you’ve found your way here, you’re probably working somewhere in the data field and trying to make sense of how all the pieces fit together in the real world and not marketing information from a vendor.

My name is David, and I’ve spent the last decade of my career building and leading data platforms. That work has included data engineering, analytics, reporting, integrations, and the messy in-between areas that don’t fit neatly into job titles. I’ve seen data initiatives succeed, stall, and fail for reasons that had very little to do with tools and everything to do with clarity, ownership, and execution.

KCDataSherpa exists as a place to write down what I’ve learned along the way.

This site will be used to share:
- Practical information based on real experience
- Lessons learned from building and operating data platforms
- Things I come across in the data field that I find interesting or worth paying attention to
- Observations about what tends to work, what doesn’t, and why

The goal is not to chase trends or hype. It’s to share information in a clear, straightforward way that’s actually useful to people doing the work.

Most posts here will be opinionated. That’s intentional. Strong opinions are easier to agree or disagree with, and they tend to lead to better conversations and better decisions.

There are no comments on this site by design. If something here resonates or sparks a reaction, feel free to share it, discuss it elsewhere, or reach out directly.

If even one post helps someone think a little more clearly about a problem they’re dealing with, this site is doing its job.
