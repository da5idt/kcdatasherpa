# AI is not your replacement. It is your force multiplier.

I just read this article from Snowflake on how data and AI are reshaping careers. While it is written by a company deeply invested in AI adoption, there is a lot in it that resonates.

The core idea is simple: the people who learn to work with AI will outpace the ones who ignore it. That does not mean blindly automating everything. It means understanding how to use AI to accelerate analysis, reduce friction, and spend more time on higher-value thinking.

That said, I have shared before a cautionary tale from my own experience. Speed without standards is a trap. If we adopt AI carelessly, we risk flooding our organizations with low-quality outputs, shallow insights, and what many are now calling “AI slop.” We already see it online. We see it in marketing. We see it in places where quantity is replacing quality.

AI should raise the bar, not lower it.

The opportunity is real. But so is the responsibility. If we treat AI as a disciplined tool inside strong engineering, governance, and review practices, it can absolutely reshape careers in a positive way.
