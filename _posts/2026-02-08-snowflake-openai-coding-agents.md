## AI Coding Agents Are No Longer the Breakthrough

🔥 Hot Take: AI coding agents aren’t the breakthrough anymore. Operating them at scale is.

I don’t have hands-on experience with Snowflake, but the Snowflake-OpenAI partnership immediately caught my attention. Based on my read, the most meaningful outcome is the direct integration of OpenAI’s new Cortex Code into Snowflake’s platform. That matters less because of the model itself and more because of how it may be delivered inside a real enterprise platform.

## The Hard Part Isn’t the Model

Coding agents have improved dramatically over the last few months. The models are no longer the hard part. The hard part has been everything around them: CI/CD, security, access controls, governance, and getting generated code safely into production. If Snowflake is genuinely baking those concerns into the platform, this could remove one of the biggest barriers to enterprise adoption.

## The 2,000 Report Problem

Here is my cautionary tale based on my personal painful experience:

At a previous company, we had what leadership viewed as a very successful self-service analytics program. Business users were empowered. Teams could analyze data quickly. On the surface, it looked like exactly what everyone wants.

Under the hood, it created real problems.

We ended up with more than 2,000 reports. Many were nearly identical, with small tweaks to “make it work for our team.” Over time, this led to duplicated logic, conflicting numbers, and constant confusion about which report was the right one to use. The platform kept growing, but trust and clarity went the opposite direction.

Now imagine that same dynamic, but instead of reports, business users can generate apps, pipelines, and logic with GenAI.

Without clear standards, ownership, and guardrails, this problem doesn’t stay manageable. It turns into an ongoing cleanup effort that falls back on data and platform teams.

## Enablement and Governance Must Move Together

I’m not anti-GenAI. I actually think this capability will be a net win for the industry. But teams that succeed will be the ones that treat enablement and governance as inseparable. You cannot bolt controls on later and expect it to work.
