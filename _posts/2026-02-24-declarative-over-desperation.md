If you are still wiring together fragile, imperative Spark jobs by hand, you are choosing complexity.

This Databricks breakdown of [Spark Declarative Pipelines](https://www.databricks.com/blog/spark-declarative-pipelines-why-data-engineering-needs-become-end-end-declarative) is worth your time.

We have been using Spark Declarative Pipelines in our Databricks environment for over a year now, and it has fundamentally changed how our team works.

Instead of spending cycles stitching together ingestion logic, retry patterns, and dependency management, we define the **what**, not the **how**.

That shift matters.

It has allowed us to rapidly ingest new data sources and move our focus up the stack toward higher-value work:

- Data modeling
- Quality and validation
- Business alignment
- Platform improvements

Are they perfect? No. Nothing is.

But they are a critical tool in our toolbox. When used correctly, they dramatically reduce the operational drag that slows down data teams.

If your engineers are buried in plumbing instead of delivering outcomes, it might be time to rethink the pattern.
